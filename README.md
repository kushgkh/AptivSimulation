# Aptiv Unity Simulation Repo 
This repo contains a Unity simulation that provides a visualization of the environment and driver's gaze using Aptiv's real highway and gaze datasets. 

Additional Features: 
- gaze tracking: Simulation ingests Aptiv’s gaze tracking format, and represents the driver's gaze with an emitted line. Cars also change color when a driver has look at them. 

- quadrant tracking: Quadrants in front of the user represent broad areas the user has viewed. When a user looks at an object in a specific quadrant it turns green. There is also a “Cooldown” period notifies driver to scan quadrants if they haven’t looked there in the past 10 seconds
